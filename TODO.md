- DONE find better year/day structure
  - DONE retrofit across previous years

- DONE is there a better way to get `WorkDir` on a `Day` then embedding `Year`?
  - DONE likely can just pass `Year` into WorkDir?
  - DONE if not, worth a comment

- DONE Year needs:
  - DONE a data dir
  - DONE an int -> function table

- DONE clean up TODOs

- remove DayN types?

- DONE can we generate (or reflect) the func table?
